Queue is FIFO data structure which means its first in and first out.
Ex: enque(10),enque(20),enque(30),enque(40),enque(50)

So the queue will look like 

10 20 30 40 50

If we do getFirst opeartion on queue than we get 10 and if we do getLast opeartion of queue it will be 50.

dequeue(),

It will remove 10 from the queue and the queue will look like

20 30 40 50

Now if we do getFirst() o/p will be 20.

Applications of queue:

1. Queue data structure main application comes into picture when we have resource which is to be shared between multiple 
users and this resource sharing is being done on the basic of first come and first serve basics.

2. Queue data structure is also being used where there needs to be a synchronised between a slow device and a fast device.
For ex: routers.

The host which sends the data is sending it at a very fast bandwidth but lets suppose that the receiver is unable 
to receive it at that much fast phase no we have a queue in between which stores the data coming from the host and once the
receiver is ready to consume the data then it will be served to it.
