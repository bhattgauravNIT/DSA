Tricks for bit magic:

1. 1 << x ~= 1* 2^x ~= 2^x;

2. n/2 ~= n >> 1;

3. n&(n-1) -> makes the first set bit of n as 0.

4. n ^ n = 0  -> This helps in finding odd occurence.

5. All power's of 2 has only 1 set bit.

6. n&1 !== 0 -> signifies that lsb bit is set.

7. n^ (1 << k)  -> makes kth bit as set.
