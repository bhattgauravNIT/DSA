1. Why array is better?

Array are contigious memory location for ex:

0     1      2      3      4    -> Index
x     x+y   x+2y    x+3y   x+4y   -> Address

So we can see the address have a relation with index: 

x + i*y is the address corresponding to any any index i. Thats why the array index start with 0 as the 0th index 
address is x which is x+ 0*y = x. 

- Due to contigious memory allocation getting any index value is 0(1) time as we are simply acccesing the value at address x + i*y.
- Caching. According to mem limit, the corresponding values are gerenally stored in cache memory which gives very quick access.


2. if we say subSets of arrays or subsets of string, it means the order of elements not need to be contigious
Ex: arr = [1,2,3]

Subsets are [1],[2],[3],[1,2],[2,3],[1,3],[1,2,3].

Powerset of this will be [1],[2],[3],[1,2],[2,3],[1,3],[1,2,3],[] (So powerset includes empty array).

Subarray however are contigious ex: [1],[2],[3],[1,2],[2,3],[1,2,3].
